    <p>The first-known use of Pig Latin dates back to late 16th-century Shakespearean England. Back then, it was called
      Hog Latin. It later resurfaced in late 19th-century English periodicals. And in 1919, what we now know as Pig
      Latin enshrined itself in popular culture forever through the song “Pig Latin Love,” sung by Arthur Fields.

      Later, the Three Stooges made it famous in the 1930s by using “ix-nay” and “am-scray” in their short comedy films.
      If you are a fan, you’ve heard those words. And even if you’ve never heard of the Three Stooges, you may have
      heard these Pig Latin words in popular usage.
      <h5>rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr</h5>

      The word “am-scray” is the Pig Latin translation of “scram”—a way to tell someone to go away fast. And the word
      “ix-nay” means “nix,” a way of suggesting that something be rejected (as in, ix-nay the red shoes, they clash with
      your pink dress). These examples show how Pig Latin has worked its way into popular English usage.

      If speaking Pig Latin sounds interesting, all you need are a few moments to learn the basics. In a few minutes’
      time, you should be able to string together some sentences and amaze your friends.</p>
